# Database Systems and Big Data

This repository hosts an interactive web page for the B103 Databases & Big Data module lectures from Gisma University of Applied Sciences (Winter 2024). The site includes descriptions of key concepts, broken into sub-chapters, and animations for potential exercises to enhance learning. It is built with HTML and CSS, hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Description
The module covers foundational database design and big data concepts, with practical implementation using SQL. This site starts with Chapter 1 (Introduction to Databases), broken into sub-chapters. Each sub-chapter provides detailed explanations, and the exercises section includes CSS-based animations to visualize concepts like table creation and data flow.
